Extend the existing project "NeuralForge PS3.23" by creating a full Responder Dashboard (Rescue Team / Authority Dashboard).

====================================
RESPONDER DASHBOARD (NEW SYSTEM)
====================================

Create a separate dashboard interface for:

- Rescue Teams
- Ambulance Teams
- Police
- Fire Brigade
- Disaster Response Teams
- Admin Control Room

This is NOT user UI.
This is the professional emergency operations interface.

====================================
FEATURES
====================================

📡 REAL-TIME INCIDENT FEED
- Live list of incoming emergency requests
- Auto-refresh / real-time updates
- WebSocket or polling-based updates
- New incident highlight animation
- Priority-based sorting:
  - Critical first
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low

Each incident card must show:
- Incident ID
- Message from user
- AI category
- Priority
- Severity
- Risk
- Required help
- Authority type
- Location (text)
- GPS coordinates
- Detected language
- Time received
- Status

====================================

📍 MAP VIEW
- Live map (OpenStreetMap / Leaflet.js)
- Pin drop for each emergency
- Color-coded markers:
  - Red = Critical
  - Orange = High
  - Yellow = Medium
  - Green = Low
- Click marker → incident details panel

====================================

🔔 NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
- Real-time alerts
- Sound alerts
- Visual alert popup
- Priority-based alert tones
- Browser notifications API
- Desktop notification permission

====================================

🧭 TEAM OPERATIONS PANEL
For each incident:
- Accept incident button
- Reject incident button
- Escalate incident
- Mark as "In Progress"
- Mark as "Resolved"
- Add response notes
- Assign team members
- Set ETA
- Update status

====================================

📊 CONTROL ROOM DASHBOARD
Admin view:
- Total incidents
- Active incidents
- Resolved incidents
- Pending incidents
- Team availability
- Response time stats
- Heatmap view
- Analytics charts

====================================

BACKEND UPGRADES
====================================

Add new API endpoints:

POST /api/emergency            -> create incident
GET  /api/incidents            -> list all incidents
GET  /api/incidents/active     -> active only
GET  /api/incidents/{id}       -> incident detail
POST /api/incidents/{id}/accept
POST /api/incidents/{id}/resolve
POST /api/incidents/{id}/assign
POST /api/incidents/{id}/status

====================================

DATA MODEL
====================================

Incident Schema:
{
  incident_id,
  message,
  category,
  priority,
  severity,
  risk,
  required_help,
  authority,
  location_text,
  latitude,
  longitude,
  detected_language,
  status,
  assigned_team,
  eta,
  created_at,
  updated_at
}

====================================

TECH STACK
====================================

Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Leaflet.js (maps)
- WebSocket / polling
- Browser Notification API

Backend:
- FastAPI
- WebSocket support
- In-memory DB or SQLite
- Real-time event broadcasting
- CORS enabled
- Role-based endpoints
- API authentication (basic token auth)

====================================

====================================

IMPORTANT RULES
====================================

- No mock data
- No fake incidents
- No static JSON
- No hardcoded alerts
- Must use real backend data
- Must use real API calls
- Must support real-time updates
- Must be scalable
- Must be modular
- Must be deployable
- Must be production structured
- Must be hackathon-grade
- Must support future mobile app
- Must support multi-agency system

====================================

SYSTEM GOAL
====================================

Create a real Emergency Operations Platform:

User Dashboard → Incident Creation  
AI Engine → Classification  
Routing Engine → Authority Mapping  
Incident Store → Persistence  
Responder Dashboard → Live Operations  
Admin Panel → Control Room  
Notification Engine → Alerts  
Map Engine → Geo Visualization  

====================================

OUTPUT
====================================

Generate:
- Full responder dashboard frontend
- Backend API upgrades
- WebSocket system
- Incident management system
- Database schema
- Real-time architecture
- Full code files
